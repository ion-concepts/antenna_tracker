During the #DARAPHackFest @[trondeau](https://github.com/trondeau) and I cooked up a little side project to give us a contributary task:
The idea was to use a drone as it's own antenna turntable, to test radiation patterns of mounted antenna's in the real world enviroment of flight with associated interactions with aerostructures and aircraft sourced EMI.
We started by substituting a servo driven turn table for the drone, and developed some code to measure and record RSSI and plot them but then got no further due to distractions.

Require's a Pololu servo controller, some form of servo driven turntable, and a USRP to be used as is currently.
